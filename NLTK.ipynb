      "    NLTK Language Modeling Module.\n",
      "    ------------------------------\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Currently this module covers only ngram language models, but it should be easy\n",
      "    to extend to neural models.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    \n",
      "    Preparing Data\n",
      "    ==============\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Before we train our ngram models it is necessary to make sure the data we put in\n",
      "    them is in the right format.\n",
      "    Let's say we have a text that is a list of sentences, where each sentence is\n",
      "    a list of strings. For simplicity we just consider a text consisting of\n",
      "    characters instead of words.\n",
      "    \n",
      "        >>> text = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['a', 'c', 'd', 'c', 'e', 'f']]\n",
      "    \n",
      "    If we want to train a bigram model, we need to turn this text into bigrams.\n",
      "    Here's what the first sentence of our text would look like if we use a function\n",
      "    from NLTK for this.\n",
      "    \n",
      "        >>> from nltk.util import bigrams\n",
      "        >>> list(bigrams(text[0]))\n",
      "        [('a', 'b'), ('b', 'c')]\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Notice how \"b\" occurs both as the first and second member of different bigrams\n",
      "    but \"a\" and \"c\" don't? Wouldn't it be nice to somehow indicate how often sentences\n",
      "    start with \"a\" and end with \"c\"?\n",
      "    A standard way to deal with this is to add special \"padding\" symbols to the\n",
      "    sentence before splitting it into ngrams.\n",
      "    Fortunately, NLTK also has a function for that, let's see what it does to the\n",
      "    first sentence.\n",
      "    \n",
      "        >>> from nltk.util import pad_sequence\n",
      "        >>> list(pad_sequence(text[0],\n",
      "        ... pad_left=True,\n",
      "        ... left_pad_symbol=\"<s>\",\n",
      "        ... pad_right=True,\n",
      "        ... right_pad_symbol=\"</s>\",\n",
      "        ... n=2))\n",
      "        ['<s>', 'a', 'b', 'c', '</s>']\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Note the `n` argument, that tells the function we need padding for bigrams.\n",
      "    Now, passing all these parameters every time is tedious and in most cases they\n",
      "    can be safely assumed as defaults anyway.\n",
      "    Thus our module provides a convenience function that has all these arguments\n",
      "    already set while the other arguments remain the same as for `pad_sequence`.\n",
      "    \n",
      "        >>> from nltk.lm.preprocessing import pad_both_ends\n",

      "    \n",

      "    defines which words are \"known\" to the model.\n",
      "    To create this vocabulary we need to pad our sentences (just like for counting\n",
